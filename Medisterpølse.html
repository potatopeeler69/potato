    <h1>Medisterpølse</h1>
    <p class="center">Medisterpølse, medisterkorv or simply medister, is a Scandinavian specialty food consisting of a thick, spiced sausage made of minced pork and suet (or lard), stuffed into a casing. It is a slightly sweet-tasting sausage and the finely-ground meat is seasoned with chopped onion, allspice, cloves, salt and pepper. It is a traditional dinner sausage in Danish cuisine.</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg pork (could be a cheaper cut like shoulder)</li>

        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground allspice</li>
        <li>½-1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons potato starch</li>
        <li>2 egg whites</li>
        <li>about 300 ml chicken stock, ice cold</li>

        <li>Make sure that all your ingredients are cold.</li>
        <li>Cut meat, pork belly and onion in pieces that can go into the meat grinder. Grind it all 2 time on the corse setting. Add all the spices, potato starch and egg whites and mix it well. Start adding the cold chicken stock a little at a time. You want the mixture to be soft but by no means runny.  Put the mixture into the refrigerator to rest for 30-40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rinse the casings in plenty of cold running water. Let tap water run through the casing. This way you’ll fine any holes in the casing.</li>
        <li>Take a little dollop of the mixture and fry it on a small skillet, and tast it, when its cooked completely. This way you can taste the mixture, without tasting the raw meat. Season the mixture with salt, pepper and other spices.</li>
        <li>Use a sausage filler to fill up the casing. There are many different model on the marked, but follow the instructions for the one you have.</li>
