    <h1>Æbleflæsk</h1>
    <p class="center">This dish, Danish apple pork, it a real traditional Danish Christmas dish typically served for a Christmas dinner. In Danish we call this dish Aebleflaesk which translated means Apple pork, and that's what it is. Aebleflaesk is a very simple dish which is based on three ingredients, apples, onions and streaky pork. As said, Aebleflaesk is a very traditional Danish dish but it's also a very regional dish which is prepared in different ways depending on which parts of Denmark you are from. This recipe is the one my family have always used and it's also the one I always use.</p>
