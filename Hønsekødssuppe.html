    <h1>Hønsekødsuppe</h1>
    <p class="center">Literally translated to hens soup, hønsekødssuppe is a chicken soup with no chicken in it.  Sort of.  A broth is made with a whole chicken but then the chicken is cast aside and pork meatballs and dumplings end up stealing the show.  Of course the Danish don't throw the chicken away, they have a whole suite of other recipes for poached chicken, but more often than not they make little chicken and asparagus tartlets called høns og asparges which also uses up some of the excess broth.  You'll rarely find a recipe for one of them without the other being referenced and in keeping up the tradition I have done the same.</p>
