    <h1>Frikadeller</h1>
    <p class="center">This recipe for Danish meatballs also known as Frikadeller is properly one of the most, if not the most, popular national dish in Denmark. For most of the Danes this is a dish they have on a regular basis and a dish that they have had their entire life.</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2><hr>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg ground pork</li>
        <li>1 dl milk</li>
        <li>1 dl oats</li>
        <li>1 dl all-purpose flour (or breadcrumbs)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 large onions (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>Pepper according to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl using a spoon or hand mixer.</li>
        <li>Heat up a frying pan with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon to form the meatballs. If you dip the spoon in a glass of water before you form a meatball it will be easier and the meat will not stick to the spoon. Fry the meatballs for about 5-10 minutes depending on the amount of heat you give them. It is best to flip over the meatball often - this will give then an even crust.</li>
