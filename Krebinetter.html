    <h1>Krebinetter</h1>
    <p class="center">This traditional dish is in Danish called Karbonader or sometimes Krebinetter. I have always called them Krebinetter. However, I must confess after having searched around the internet I think the most common name for this dish is Karbonader. The word Karbonader can't be translated into English but they can be called Danish Breaded Pork Patties. I am not sure if this dish was originally invented in Denmark. However, it has always been a popular and traditional dish on the Danish dinner table.</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g (1 lb) ground pork 12% fat (traditional it’s a mix of pork and veal meat)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tbsp water</li>
        <li>70 g (2.5 oz) bread crumbs salt and pepper</li>
        <li>50 g (1 1/2 oz) of butter (or oil)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by dividing the meat into 5 portions of about 100 g each (or 1/5 lb each) and shape them into circular thick patties.</li>
        <li>In a deep plate; beat the egg together with the water.</li>
        <li>In a second plate; mix the bread crumbs together with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Now dip the pork patties in the egg mixture and then in the breadcrumbs. Make sure the entire patty is covered with breadcrumbs. One time should be enough but if you like a thicker layer of breading – then repeat this step one more time.</li>
        <li>On a frying pan; add the butter and fry the breaded pork patties for about 5-8 minutes. Flip them over from time-to-time.</li>
    </ol>
